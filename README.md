# Survive!

Survive! is a 2D survival game.

Stuck in a room with no where else to go, defend against waves of enemies 
for as long as you can! The longer you live, the stronger your enemies get, so don't
let them catch you!

## Functionality and MVPs

In Survive!, players will:
- Move their character with the left, right, up, and down arrow keys
- Shoot with spacebar to damage enemies
- Lose once their character runs out of health
- Be able to pause the game at any time

The enemies will:
- Follow the player until they are destroyed
- Gain more health and damage as the game goes on
- Spawn in larger numbers each wave

In addition, this project will include:
- Instructions describing the background and rules of the game
- A production README
